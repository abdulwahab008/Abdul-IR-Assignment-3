# Relevance Judgments for News Articles Dataset
# 
# NOTE: These are placeholder relevance judgments.
# After building the index and running initial queries, you should:
# 1. Run each query and manually review the top results
# 2. Identify which documents are truly relevant
# 3. Update this file with actual relevant document IDs
#
# Format: query_id -> list of relevant document IDs
# Document IDs follow the pattern: news_XXXXX (e.g., news_00001, news_00150)
